<p >. I am Ahmed Khalil Hemaid ,I am 20 years old ,when I was 15 years old I was looking for learn programming , I delay it to the day that I finish school .
  After I finished school I looked for an academy to learn programming , I did not like to jion at universty because I need to learn programming only . In 2017 I heard about code Academy . and I apply to this Academy ,when I heard about it I think that my dream will come true .I'm here to learn and I am on my way to be a successful web-developer and I'll be InSh'aAllah</p>
